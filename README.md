# Budget Helper

For a while now, I've been using a Google Sheet to track my bi-weekly expenses. This was in an effort to be more mindful about my finances. One day, I got tired of creating new sheets from a template and decided to build this tool.

Not only do I like keeping track of where my money previously went to better understand my spending habits, I like to manually enter my expenses each pay period to better understand where my money is going.

This has been helpful for me and hopefully it can be for you as well!
